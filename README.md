OpenURL
==========
#### Current Version: 1.2.3

This is a simple and lightweight addon that allows any player to open the any website on a any connected player.

This addon has the ability to open the website in either a custom in-game browser or you can use the steam web browser.

If you want to play a YouTube video you can enable the 'YouTube Video' mode and when the website loads on the selected player it will put it in fullscreen and auto-play the video.

If your worried about other players opening rude or illegal websites on players, Don't be. The player that you want to open the website on has to verify that they want to open it before anything happens.

You can open the menu by typing '/url' into chat.

This is not a clientside addon, You can only use it if the server owner has it installed. You can't hop on a random server and expect to be opening websites on people.

This addon is also on the workshop!, Check it out [here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=838960710)
